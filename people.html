    <h2> Who Are The People Affected </h2>
    <li>All US citizens who are residents of Pennsylvania and are at least over the age of 18. However the difficulties in getting your mail-in ballot accepted and voting in general often disproportionately affect black and brown low-income communities.</li>
       <li>Voting should be easy however many communities find themselves targeted and have measures passed that makes it hard to cast a ballot. These factors are only aggravated due to the pandemic and therefore as a community we all have to be as informed as possible on this topic otherwise we can find ourselves in a repeat of history and face mass disenfranchisement. </li>
       <li>"Suppression efforts range from the seemingly unobstructive, like voter ID laws and cuts to early voting, to mass purges of voter rolls and systematic disenfranchisement. And long before election cycles even begin, legislators can redraw district lines that determine the weight of your vote. Certain communities are particularly susceptible to suppression and in some cases, outright targeted - people of color, students, the elderly, and people with disabilities"( ACLU).</li>
